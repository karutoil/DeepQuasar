# Playlist Support Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. YouTube Playlist Support
- **Problem**: Play command checked for `'PLAYLIST_LOADED'` but Shoukaku v4 returns `'playlist'`
- **Fix**: Updated condition to check for `result.loadType === 'playlist'`
- **Result**: YouTube playlists now properly queue all tracks

### 2. Spotify Playlist/Album Support  
- **Problem**: Only Spotify tracks were supported, not playlists or albums
- **Fix**: Added detection for Spotify playlist and album URLs
- **Pattern matching**:
  - Tracks: `/track/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)`
  - Playlists: `/playlist/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)`  
  - Albums: `/album/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)`

### 3. User Feedback
- **Added**: Loading messages for different content types
  - YouTube playlists: "ðŸ“‹ Loading YouTube playlist..."
  - Spotify tracks: "ðŸŽµ Converting Spotify track to playable source..."
  - Spotify playlists: "ðŸŽµ Converting Spotify playlist to playable source..."
  - Spotify albums: "ðŸŽµ Converting Spotify album to playable source..."

### 4. Better Error Messages
- **YouTube playlists**: Specific guidance for playlist issues
- **Spotify content**: Region availability and URL format tips
- **Generic**: Fallback error handling

### 5. Debug Logging
- **Added**: Comprehensive logging for playlist detection
- **Includes**: Track count, playlist name, load type, original query
- **Purpose**: Better troubleshooting for playlist issues

## Supported URL Formats

### YouTube
- Single videos: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- Playlists: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID&list=PLAYLIST_ID`
- Playlist only: `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID`

### Spotify  
- Tracks: `https://open.spotify.com/track/TRACK_ID`
- Playlists: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/PLAYLIST_ID`
- Albums: `https://open.spotify.com/album/ALBUM_ID`

## Configuration
- **YouTube**: `youtubePlaylistLoadLimit: 15` (configurable in Lavalink)
- **Spotify**: `playlistLoadLimit: 6` and `albumLoadLimit: 6` (LavalSrc plugin)
- **Queue limits**: Respects premium vs free user limits

This ensures both YouTube and Spotify playlists/albums will properly queue all tracks instead of just the first one.
