# Spotify URL Handling Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Spotify URL Resolution
- **Problem**: Spotify URLs from history couldn't be played directly
- **Solution**: Detect Spotify URLs and process them through the Spotify source for resolution
- **Implementation**: Added URL detection and source override for `open.spotify.com` links

### 2. History Management
- **Problem**: Spotify URLs were being saved in history instead of playable URLs
- **Solution**: Save the resolved track information (YouTube URL, etc.) instead of original Spotify URL
- **Implementation**: Use `firstTrack.info.uri` and `firstTrack.info.sourceName` for history

### 3. Autocomplete Improvement
- **Problem**: Autocomplete showed unusable Spotify URLs
- **Solution**: Convert Spotify URLs in history to "Title Artist" format for autocomplete
- **Implementation**: Detect Spotify URLs in autocomplete and use title/artist instead

### 4. User Feedback
- **Added**: Loading message when converting Spotify tracks
- **Improved**: Better error messages for failed Spotify resolution

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: Check if query contains `open.spotify.com`
2. **Processing**: Set source to `spotify` for proper resolution via LavalSrc plugin
3. **Resolution**: Lavalink resolves Spotify track to playable source (YouTube)
4. **History**: Save the resolved track info (YouTube URL) instead of Spotify URL
5. **Autocomplete**: Show title/artist for Spotify tracks instead of URLs

This ensures Spotify tracks from history will work properly when selected from autocomplete.
