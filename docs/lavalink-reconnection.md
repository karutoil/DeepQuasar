# Lavalink Reconnection Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to handle Lavalink server disconnections and automatic reconnection.

## Problem Statement

Previously, when the Lavalink server disconnected, the Discord bot would require a manual restart to restore music functionality. This affected both playback and search operations.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Moonlink.js Configuration

- **Automatic Retry**: Configured `retryAmount: 10` and `retryDelay: 5000ms` for persistent reconnection attempts
- **Session Resuming**: Enabled `resume: true` and `autoResume: true` to restore player state after reconnection
- **Player Migration**: Enabled `movePlayersOnReconnect: true` to move players to available nodes during outages

### 2. Connection State Monitoring

Added comprehensive connection health monitoring in `MusicPlayerManager.js`:

- `getConnectionHealth()`: Returns detailed status of all nodes
- `isOperational()`: Quick check if music system is functional
- `ensureNodeConnection()`: Waits for node connection with timeout

### 3. Improved Event Handling

Enhanced event handlers in `index.js`:

- **Node Disconnection**: Notifies users about connection issues in active channels
- **Reconnection Attempts**: Shows reconnecting status to users
- **Successful Reconnection**: Confirms restoration of service

### 4. Search Resilience

Implemented retry logic in search operations:

- **Automatic Retry**: Up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Connection Waiting**: Waits up to 10 seconds for node reconnection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messages when service is unavailable

### 5. Command Error Handling

Enhanced music commands (`play.js`, `search.js`) with:

- **Pre-execution Checks**: Verify system operational status before attempting operations
- **Connection-aware Error Messages**: Distinguish between search failures and connection issues
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for voice channel connections

### 6. New Status Command

Added `/music-status` command for real-time monitoring:

- Shows connection status of all nodes
- Displays active player count
- Provides recommendations based on current state
- Color-coded status indicators

## Key Features

### Automatic Reconnection
- The bot now automatically attempts to reconnect to Lavalink servers
- Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming disconnected servers
- Up to 10 reconnection attempts before considering a node destroyed

### User Communication
- Users are notified when connections are lost
- Real-time updates during reconnection attempts
- Success confirmation when service is restored

### Graceful Degradation
- Commands fail gracefully with helpful error messages
- Search operations retry automatically
- Connection state is checked before expensive operations

### Monitoring Tools
- New `/music-status` command for administrators
- Detailed connection health information
- Active player monitoring

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite included:

- `test/test-reconnection.js`: Validates automatic reconnection logic
- `test/test-connection-health.js`: Tests health monitoring functions

## Benefits

1. **Zero-downtime Recovery**: Bot continues working after Lavalink server restarts
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear communication about service status
3. **Reduced Support Load**: Fewer manual restarts required
4. **Proactive Monitoring**: Administrators can check system health
5. **Resilient Operations**: Commands handle connection issues gracefully

## Configuration

The improvements use the existing Lavalink configuration in `config/bot.js`. No additional configuration is required.

## Monitoring

Use the new `/music-status` command to monitor:
- Node connection status
- Reconnection attempts
- Active player count
- Overall system health

This implementation ensures the Discord bot maintains music functionality even during temporary Lavalink server outages, significantly improving reliability and user experience.
