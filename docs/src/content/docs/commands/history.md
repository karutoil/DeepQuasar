# `history`

This command allows you to view your personal music playback history and re-queue songs directly from it. It's an interactive way to revisit your favorite tracks.

## How to Use

To access your music history, simply use the command without any options:

```sh
/history
```

Upon execution, the bot will display an embed with a paginated list of your recently played songs. You can navigate through pages using the "Back" and "Forward" buttons. A select menu will also be available, allowing you to pick a song from the current page to play.

## Examples

```sh
# View your music history
/history

# Navigate through history pages
# Click the "⬅️ Back" or "Forward ➡️" buttons on the history embed.

# Play a song from history
# Select a song from the dropdown menu on the history embed.
```
