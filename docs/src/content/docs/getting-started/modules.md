# Enabling Bot Modules

DeepQuasar is designed with a modular architecture, allowing you to enable and configure features as needed for your server. This guide will walk you through the commands used to activate and set up the bot's core functionalities.

Each module typically has a `setup` or `toggle` command to get started, followed by more detailed configuration options.

## Core Modules and How to Enable Them

Here's a list of key modules and the commands to enable them:

### ü§ñ AI Chatbot

To enable or disable the AI Chatbot module for your server:

*   Use the `/chatbot toggle` command.

    /chatbot toggle enabled:True
    ```
*   For more details, refer to the [chatbot command documentation](/commands/chatbot).
