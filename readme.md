## Getting Started

### Running Tests

To run all tests and get a clear, easy-to-read summary of successes and failures (including file and line number for each failure), use:

```
npm test -- --verbose --testLocationInResults
```

For a minimal output that only shows failures, you can use:

```
npm test -- --reporters jest-silent-reporter --testLocationInResults
```

Both commands will show you how many tests passed and failed, and the location of any failures.
