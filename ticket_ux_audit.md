# Ticket Module UX & Bug Audit

## 1. Ticket Assignment & Staff Selection

- **Good:** Staff selection modal now works and lists all staff.
- **Resolved:** After assignment, the welcome message and channel topic are now updated to reflect the new assignee. If permissions are an issue, errors are handled gracefully and the user is notified.

## 2. Permissions & Error Handling

- **Good:** Most actions check for permissions and reply with clear error messages.
- **Resolved:** If the bot lacks permissions (e.g., Manage Channels), the user is now always notified in Discord with a clear error message, not just in logs.

## 3. Modal/SelectMenu Interactions

- **Good:** Modal and select menu flows are robust and now avoid "This interaction failed" errors.
- **Resolved:** If a staff member leaves the server between modal open and submit, the user now receives a friendly error: "The selected staff member is no longer available. Please try again and select a different staff member."

## 4. Ticket Creation

- **Good:** Duplicate ticketId errors are handled with retries.
- **Resolved:** If all retries fail, the user now receives a more specific error message explaining the failure (e.g., duplicate ticket IDs or the actual error reason).

## 5. Ticket Listing & Info

- **Good:** `/ticket list` and `/ticket info` provide clear, detailed information.
- **Note:** Channel existence is checked and missing channels are handled with user-facing messages.

## 6. Tag Management

- **Good:** Tag add/remove/list flows are clear.
- **Resolved:** All tag-related replies are now ephemeral for privacy, including add, remove, and list actions.

## 7. Priority Setting

- **Good:** Priority can be set and is reflected in ticket info/list.
- **Resolved:** If the ticket is already at the requested priority, the user receives a warning message and no change is made.

## 8. General UX

- **Good:** Most user-facing messages are clear and use embeds.
- **Resolved:** Error messages now include the reason for failure where possible (e.g., missing permissions, not found, etc.).

## 9. Rate Limiting

- **Good:** Rate limiting is implemented for ticket creation.
- **Resolved:** The rate limit message now includes a timestamp or duration indicating when the user can next create a ticket.

## 10. Miscellaneous

- **Resolved:** After deletion, the system is set up to DM the user or provide a final confirmation in the channel if possible.
