## Advanced Ticket System Module Prompt

Please develop a modular and scalable ticket system for my Discord bot with rich features focused on ease of use, customizability, and administrative control.

---

### 🎫 Ticket Panel
- A customizable ticket panel sent as an **embed**, using the embed style from `#file:utils.js`.
- Panel can be posted to any channel by a **server admin**.
- Supports **interactive buttons** that represent different ticket types (e.g., "Support", "Bug Report", "Partnership").
- Admins can dynamically **add/remove buttons** and **assign emojis**, labels, and ticket type descriptions.
- Clicking a button prompts a **modal** asking for a description or reason for the ticket.

---

### 📝 Ticket Creation & Management
- A new **private channel** is created under an "Open Tickets" category with proper permissions (user + staff).
- The channel name can follow a pattern (e.g., `ticket-username`, `ticket-####`).
- Once resolved, the ticket can be:
  - Moved to the "Closed Tickets" category
  - Archived or deleted (with logging)
- Support for **auto-close tickets** after X minutes/hours of inactivity (configurable).

---

### 🔧 In-Ticket Controls
Each ticket channel includes a set of **action buttons** or a command context menu:
- ✅ **Close Ticket**: Moves to "Closed Tickets", optionally asks for a closing reason.
- 🧑‍💼 **Assign Ticket**: Lets staff claim the ticket, optionally with a note.
- ❌ **Delete Ticket**: Deletes the channel and posts a summary to the mod-log.
- 🔄 **Reopen Ticket**: Moves from Closed back to Open with user re-added.

---

### 🛠️ Configuration & Admin Features
- Only **server administrators** can:
  - Create/manage ticket panels.
  - Set "Open" and "Closed" category channels.
  - Set a **mod-log** channel.
  - Configure ticket naming format.
  - Customize modal questions (e.g., custom forms per ticket type).
- All configuration is stored **per-guild**.

---

### 🧠 Smart Features
- 🔒 **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam by limiting how often users can create tickets.
- 👥 **Staff Roles**: Specify which roles are allowed to manage/see tickets.
- 🧾 **Ticket Transcripts**:
  - On close/delete, optionally generate a full transcript and send to mod-log or archive it.
- 📨 **DM Confirmations**:
  - Optionally send the user a DM when their ticket is opened, closed, or responded to.
- 🧩 **Tagging System**:
  - Staff can tag tickets (e.g., "urgent", "billing", "other") for sorting/priority.
- 📥 **Ticket Queue Dashboard** (Optional Command):
  - Command like `/tickets list` to show all open tickets, assignments, and statuses (staff-only).

---

### 🔓 Permissions & Security
- Fine-grained permission checks to ensure only allowed users access tickets.
- All sensitive actions (delete, assign, etc.) require confirmation or elevated permission.
- Commands for `/panel create`, `/panel edit`, `/panel delete`, etc.

---

### 🔄 Extensibility
- Codebase should be **modular** for future expansion (e.g., database backends, UI improvements).
- Support storing settings in **MongoDB**, SQLite, or similar if needed.
- Structure should allow **easy localization/translations** in the future.

---

### 🧪 Developer Notes
- Use Discord's latest **Interactions API** (buttons, modals, slash commands).
- Make setup and use **as intuitive as possible** — preferably with slash commands and minimal external config.
- Ensure **error handling and logging** is robust.
- Designed with **multi-guild scalability** in mind.
