# ModLog System Audit

## General Observations

The modlog system is well-structured and covers a wide range of Discord events. It provides configuration via slash commands, supports per-event channel assignment, and toggling of event logging. The code is modular and leverages Discord.js and Mongoose best practices.

---

## Issues, Bugs, and Missing Features

### 1. **No Permissions Check for Setup/Configuration**
- The `/modlog setup` and other configuration commands do not check if the bot has permission to send messages or embed links in the selected channel. This could lead to silent failures if the bot cannot log events.

### 2. **No Validation for Event Type in `setchannel` and `toggle`**
- The code assumes the provided event type string is valid and present in the schema. If an invalid event type is passed (e.g., via autocomplete bug or manual API call), it will throw an error (`Cannot read properties of undefined`).

### 3. **No Feedback for Already-Set Channel or State**
- When setting a channel or toggling an event, there is no feedback if the channel is already set or the event is already in the desired state.

### 4. **No Support for Logging to Multiple Channels**
- The system only supports one channel per event. Some servers may want to log the same event to multiple channels.

### 5. **No Support for Webhook Logging**
- Logging is only done via text channels. Webhook support could allow for richer formatting and cross-server logging.

### 6. **No Rate Limiting or Flood Protection**
- If a large number of events occur in a short time, the bot may hit Discord rate limits or spam the channel.

### 7. **No Error Handling for Channel Deletion**
- If a channel set for logging is deleted, the system does not automatically fall back to the default channel or notify admins.

### 8. **No Event Filtering by User/Role**
- There is no way to exclude certain users/roles from being logged (e.g., ignore bot joins/leaves).

### 9. **No Support for Custom Message Templates**
- All log messages use a fixed embed format. There is no support for custom templates or message content per event.

### 10. **No Audit Log Fallback/Enhancement**
- The audit log fetch in `ModLogManager.getAuditLogEntry` is not used in the main logging flow. For events like bans/kicks, it would be useful to include executor info from audit logs.

### 11. **No Pagination or Filtering in Status/Configure**
- The `/modlog status` and `/modlog configure` commands do not support pagination or filtering for servers with many events or complex setups.

### 12. **No Support for Logging Event Data**
- Only basic info is logged. For some events (e.g., message delete), the deleted content is not shown if not cached.

### 13. **No Migration or Schema Update Handling**
- If new events are added to the schema, existing documents may not have those fields, leading to undefined errors.

### 14. **No Localization/Internationalization**
- All messages and embeds are hardcoded in English.

### 15. **No Notification on Disable**
- When modlog is disabled, there is no notification sent to the log channel or admins.

### 17. **No Logging of Configuration Changes**
- Changes to modlog settings (e.g., enabling/disabling events, changing channels) are not logged anywhere.

### 19. **No Handling for Guild Removal**
- If the bot is removed from a guild, modlog data is not cleaned up.

### 20. **No Integration with Other Moderation Systems**
- The modlog system does not integrate with punishment logs, ticket systems, or other moderation features.

## Recommendations

- Add validation and error handling for event types and channel existence.
- Consider supporting multiple channels and/or webhooks per event.
- Implement rate limiting and flood protection.
- Add audit log integration for executor info.
- Support custom templates and localization.
- Log configuration changes and notify admins on important actions.
- Handle schema migrations and missing fields gracefully.
- Add filtering options for users/roles and event types.
