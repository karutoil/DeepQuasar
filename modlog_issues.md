# ModLog System Audit

## General Observations

The modlog system is well-structured and covers a wide range of Discord events. It provides configuration via slash commands, supports per-event channel assignment, and toggling of event logging. The code is modular and leverages Discord.js and Mongoose best practices.

## Issues, Bugs, and Missing Features

- Implemented: `/modlog setup` and channel selection now check for `SendMessages` and `EmbedLinks` permissions.

### 8. **No Event Filtering by User/Role** ✅
- Implemented: User/role exclusion supported per event.

### 9. **No Support for Custom Message Templates** ✅
- Implemented: Custom templates supported per event.

### 10. **No Audit Log Fallback/Enhancement** ✅

### 11. **No Pagination or Filtering in Status/Configure** ✅

### 12. **No Support for Logging Event Data** ✅
- Implemented: Deleted message content and attachments are logged if available.

### 13. **No Migration or Schema Update Handling** ✅

### 14. **No Localization/Internationalization** ❌
- Not yet implemented.

### 15. **No Notification on Disable** ✅
