# User Management Controls for Locked/Hidden Channels

## Summary
Added dedicated user management controls that appear in the control panel when a temporary voice channel is locked or hidden. This makes it much easier for channel owners to manage permissions without having to use slash commands.

## New Features

### 1. Dynamic Control Panel
The control panel now dynamically shows additional user management buttons when a channel is locked or hidden:

- **Allow User** (✅) - Opens a user selection menu to allow specific users to join
- **Deny User** (❌) - Opens a user selection menu to deny specific users from joining  
- **Manage Permissions** (⚙️) - Shows current permission overview with management options

### 2. User Selection Menus
- Native Discord user selection menus for easy user searching and selection
- Works with Discord's built-in user search functionality
- Prevents selection of bots or invalid users

### 3. Enhanced Control Panel Display
- Shows permission counts when channel is locked/hidden
- Displays number of allowed, denied, and moderator users
- Updates automatically when permissions change

### 4. Comprehensive Permission Management
The "Manage Permissions" view shows:
- List of allowed users (up to 10, with count if more)
- List of denied/blocked users
- List of moderators
- Quick action buttons to allow/deny more users

## How It Works

### Button Interactions
1. **When channel is locked or hidden**: Additional user management row appears
2. **Allow User button**: Opens user selection menu → user gains access permissions
3. **Deny User button**: Opens user selection menu → user loses access and gets kicked if present
4. **Manage Permissions button**: Shows comprehensive permission overview

### User Selection Flow
1. User clicks "Allow User" or "Deny User" button
2. Discord's native user selection menu appears
3. User selects target user from searchable list
4. Permissions are applied immediately
5. Control panel updates to reflect changes
6. Settings are auto-saved (if enabled)

### Select Menu Integration
The same options are available in the select menu when using select-style controls:
- "Allow User" option appears when channel is locked/hidden
- "Deny User" option appears when channel is locked/hidden  
- "Manage Permissions" option appears when channel is locked/hidden

## Technical Implementation

### Control Panel Logic
- `createControlPanelComponents()` checks if channel is locked/hidden
- Adds fourth button row with user management controls
- Updates select menu options dynamically based on channel state

### Interaction Routing
- Extended custom ID parsing to handle multi-word actions (`allow_user`, `deny_user`, `manage_permissions`)
- Added new handler methods in `TempVCControlHandlers`
- Proper delegation from `TempVCManager.handleControlPanelInteraction()`

### User Selection Handling
- Uses Discord's `UserSelectMenuBuilder` for native user search
- Handles user selection in `handleSelectMenuInteraction()` 
- Applies permissions via Discord API and updates instance data
- Auto-saves settings after permission changes

## Benefits

1. **Intuitive UX**: No need to remember slash commands for basic permission management
2. **Native Search**: Uses Discord's built-in user search instead of manual user ID entry
3. **Visual Feedback**: Control panel shows current permission state at a glance
4. **Persistent**: All permission changes are auto-saved and persist across channel recreations
5. **Contextual**: Controls only appear when relevant (locked/hidden channels)

## Usage Examples

### Locking a Channel and Managing Access
1. User clicks "Lock" button → channel becomes locked
2. Additional user management controls appear
3. User clicks "Allow User" → selects friends from menu → they can join
4. User clicks "Manage Permissions" → sees overview of all permissions

### Hidden Channel with Selective Access
1. User clicks "Hide" button → channel becomes hidden
2. User management controls appear
3. User can easily allow specific people while keeping channel hidden from others
4. Permission overview shows who has access

This implementation makes permission management much more user-friendly and accessible directly from the control panel interface.
